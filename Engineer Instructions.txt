Engineer Instructions:

1. Go to inputs.json file (you can open this in this vscode IDE)

2."Folder Path": Input the path to the folder with your raw data 
    #ensure that your filepath has "/" not "\"
    #only have datalog and mfc raw data in the folder 

3."Data Pack Name": The name for your data pack

4."Datalog columns": The list of the datalog columns in the order you want
  them to appear in the datapack
  #for reference Column A == 0
  #ensure the format is correct e.g [0,2,3,4,etc]
  #its fine if this format extends vertically as opposed to 
  horizontally

5."Datalog names": Enter the header names, ensure he order matches your
    Datalog Columns 
    #ensure format is correct e.g ["Date/Time","Flow (g/s)","005 Inlet Analogue ETAS 1 (-)",]
    #its fine if this format extends vertically as opposed to 
    horizontally

6."MFC Columns": same process as for Datalog Columns

7."MFC names": same process as for Datalog names

8."Additional Columns": These are the column names that you want appended to your
datapack with hyphens in the datacolumn, this is used to display additional unused tcs etc.
The format is {"New column name":"name of column you want the new column inserted beside"}
e.g     {"005 Bed 2 Circumference Machine Side (°C)": "005 Bed 2 Circumference Door Side (°C)",
        "005 Bed 5 Circumference Machine Side (°C)": "005 Bed 5 Circumference Door Side (°C)",
        "006 Bed 2 Circumference Machine Side (°C)": "006 Bed 2 Circumference Door Side (°C)",
        "006 Bed 5 Circumference Machine Side (°C)": "006 Bed 5 Circumference Door Side (°C)"}

9."Excluded Columns": These are any columns that you want to ensure have hyphens in the
 data columns 
 Just enter the exact column name (must match the header name previously given)
 format: ["005 Bed 5 Circumference Machine Side (°C)",
        "006 Bed 2 Circumference Machine Side (°C)",
        "006 Bed 5 Circumference Machine Side (°C)"]

10. Running the code:
        1. You can go to the "run_DataPackTool.bat" file in vscode and hit the
        run button when on this file (run button at the top leftish, or the play arrow which
        is usually in the top right)
        2. You could also enter in the terminal below "run_DataPackTool.bat"
        3.If you prefer to run commands manually:

            ```powershell
            # Activate the virtual environment
            venv\Scripts\activate

            # Run the tool
            python df_readAndmap.py
            ```


#Notes on json file formatting:
#these inputs are in Key:value pairs (the values can be a list, map, single value
    etc)
#ensure there is a comma after the value or list of values etc before going onto the next
key/input name 
#for "Additional columns the bracket is {} not [] 
#the rest are all either single values or use []
